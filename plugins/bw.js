/**
 * The bandwidth plugin measures the bandwidth and latency of the user's network
 * connection to your server.
 *
 * Please note that bandwidth detection through JavaScript is not accurate. If
 * the user's network is lossy or is shared with other users, or network traffic
 * is bursty, real bandwidth can vary over time.
 *
 * The measurement Boomerang takes is based over a short period of time, and this may not
 * be representative of the best or worst cases. Boomerang tries to account for that by
 * measuring not just the bandwidth, but also the error value in that measurement.
 *
 * For information on how to include this plugin, see the {@tutorial building} tutorial.
 *
 * ## Setup
 *
 * The bandwidth images are located in the `images/` folder. You need to copy all
 * of these images to a location on your HTTP server.
 *
 * You may put these images on your CDN, but be aware that this could result in
 * increased CDN charges.  You will need to configure your CDN to ignore the
 * query string when caching these images.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Once Boomerang has been added to your page and {@link BOOMR.init} has been called,
 * the bandwidth test will start once the page loads.
 *
 * See the list of {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW options} for required {@link BOOMR.init}
 * configuration, e.g. {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.base_url}.
 *
 * If you want the page load beacon to include the results of the bandwidth test,
 * setting {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.block_beacon} to `true` will force boomerang
 * to wait for the test to complete before sending the beacon.
 *
 * If you do not turn on the {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.block_beacon} option,
 * you will only receive bandwidth results if they were cached in a cookie by a
 * previous test run.
 *
 * ## IPv4 optimisations
 *
 * While visitor's IP address information isn't available to JavaScript, if your server
 * can communicate the IP address to JavaScript (e.g. via HTML injection), Boomerang
 * will use it to detect if the visitor has changed networks.  See
 * {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.user_ip} for details.
 *
 * If your visitor has an IPv4 address, then Boomerang will also strip out the last
 * part of the IP and use that rather than the entire IP address.  This helps if
 * visitors use DHCP on the same ISP where their IP address changes frequently,
 * but they stay within the same subnet.
 *
 * If the visitor has an IPv6 address, we use the entire address.
 *
 * ## Cookie
 *
 * The bandwidth results are stored within a cookie.  This helps ensure the bandwidth
 * test isn't repeated for the same user repeatedly (slowing down their experience).
 *
 * You can customise the name of the cookie where the bandwidth will be stored via
 * the {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.cookie} option.
 *
 * By default this is set to `BA`.
 *
 * This cookie is set to expire in 7 days. You can change its lifetime using
 * the {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.cookie_exp} option.
 *
 * During that time, you can also read the value of the cookie on the server
 * side. Its format is as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * BA=ba=nnnnnnn&be=nnn.nn&l=nnnn&le=nn.nn&ip=iiiiii&t=sssssss;
 * ```
 *
 * The parameters are defined as:
 *
 * * `ba` [integer] [bytes/s] The user's bandwidth to your server
 * * `be` [float] [bytes/s] The 95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring the user's bandwidth
 * * `l` [float] [ms] The HTTP latency between the user's computer and your server
 * * `le` [float] [ms] The 95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring the user's latency
 * * `ip` [ip address] The user's IPv4 or IPv6 address that was passed as the user_ip parameter to the init() method
 * * `t` [timestamp] The browser time (in seconds since the epoch) when the cookie was set
 *
 * ## Disabling the bandwidth check
 *
 * Finally, there may be cases when you want to completely disable the bandwidth test --
 * perhaps you know that your user is on a slow network, or pays by the byte (the
 * andwidth test uses a lot of bandwidth), or is on a mobile device that cannot
 * handle the load.
 *
 * In such cases you have two options:
 *
 * * Delete the bandwdith plugin (`delete BOOMR.plugins.BW`)
 * * Set the {@link BOOMR.plugins.BW.init BW.enabled} parameter to `false`
 *
 * ## Methodology
 * Bandwidth and latency are measured by downloading fixed-size images from a server
 * and measuring the time it took to download them.  We run it in the following order:
 *
 * * First, download a 32 byte gif 10 times serially.  This is used to measure latency.
 *   * We discard the first measurement because that pays the price for the TCP
 *     handshake (3 packets) and TCP slow-start (4 more packets).  All other
 *     image requests take two TCP packets (one for the request and one for the
 *     response).  This gives us a good idea of how much time it takes to
 *     make a HTTP request from the browser to our server.
 *   * Once done, we calculate the arithmetic mean, standard deviation and standard
 *     error at 95% confidence for the 9 download times that we have.  This is
 *     the latency number (`lat`) and confidence intervl (`lat_err`) that we
 *     beacon back to our server.
 * * Next, download images of increasing size until one of the times out
 *   * We choose image sizes so that we can narrow down on a bandwidth range as
 *     soon as possible.
 *   * Image timeouts are set at between 1.2 and 1.5 seconds.  If an image times
 *     out, we stop downloading larger images, and retry the largest image 4
 *     more times.  We then calculate the bandwidth for the largest 3 images
 *     that we downloaded.  This should result in 7 readings unless the test
 *     timed out before that. We calculate the median, standard deviation and
 *     standard error from these values and this is the bandwidth (`bw`) and
 *     confidence interval (`bw_err`) that we beacon back to our server.
 *
 * ## Beacon Parameters
 *
 * This plugin adds the following parameters to the beacon:
 *
 * * `bw`: User's measured bandwidth in bytes per second
 * * `bw_err`: 95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring user's bandwidth
 * * `lat`: User's measured HTTP latency in milliseconds
 * * `lat_err`: 95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring user's latency
 * * `bw_time` Timestamp (seconds since the epoch) on the user's browser when
 *   the bandwidth and latency was measured
 * * `bw_debug` Debug information
 *

		 * `base_url` parameter to the HTTP path of the directory that contains
		 * the bandwidth images to enable this test.
		 *
		 * This can be an absolute or a relative URL.
		 *
		 * If it's relative, remember that it's relative to the page that boomerang is included
		 * in and not to the javascript file.
		 *
		 * The trailing / is required.
		 * @param {boolean} [config.BW.cookie] The name of the cookie in which to store
		 * the measured bandwidth and latency of the user's network connection.
		 *
		 * The default name is `BA`.
		 * @param {boolean} [config.BW.cookie_exp] The lifetime in seconds of the bandwidth cookie.
		 *
		 * The default is set to 7 days. This specifies how long it will be before
		 * we run the bandwidth test again for a user, assuming their IP address
		 * doesn't change within this time.
		 *
		 * You probably do not need to change this setting at all since the bandwidth
		 * of a given network connection typically does not change by an order
		 * of magnitude on a regular basis.
		 *
		 * Note that if you're doing some kind of real-time streaming, then
		 * chances are that this bandwidth test isn't right for you, so
		 * setting this cookie to a shorter value isn't the right solution.
		 * @param {boolean} [config.BW.timeout] The timeout in seconds for the entire bandwidth test.
		 *
		 * The default is set to 15 seconds.
		 *
		 * The bandwidth test can run for a long time, and sometimes, due to
		 * network errors, it might never complete. The timeout forces the test
		 * to complete at that time. This is a hard limit.
		 *
		 * If the timeout fires, we stop further iterations of the test and
		 * attempt to calculate bandwidth with the data that we've collected at that point.
		 *
		 * Increasing the timeout can get you more data and increase the accuracy
		 * of the test, but at the same time increases the risk of the test not
		 * completing before the user leaves the page.
		 * @param {boolean} [config.BW.nruns] The number of times the bandwidth test should run.
		 *
		 * The default is set to 5.
		 *
		 * The first test is always a pilot to figure out the best way to proceed
		 * with the remaining tests. Increasing this number will increase the
		 * tests accuracy, but at the same time increases the risk that the test will timeout.
		 *
		 * It should take about 2-4 seconds per run, so consider this value along with the timeout value above.
		 * @param {boolean} [config.BW.test_https] By default, boomerang will skip the bandwidth
		 * test over an HTTPS connection.
		 *
		 * Establishing an SSL connection takes time, which could skew the
		 * bandwidth results. If all your traffic is sent over SSL, then running
		 * the test over SSL probably gets you what you want.
