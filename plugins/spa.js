/**
 * Enables Single Page App (SPA) performance monitoring.
 *
 * **Note**: The `SPA` plugin requires the {@link BOOMR.plugins.AutoXHR} plugin
 * to be loaded before `SPA`, and one of the following SPA plugins to work:
 *
 * * {@link BOOMR.plugins.Angular}
 * * {@link BOOMR.plugins.Backbone}
 * * {@link BOOMR.plugins.Ember}
 * * {@link BOOMR.plugins.History} (React and all other SPA support)
 *
 * You also need to disable {@link BOOMR.init|autorun} when enabling SPA support.
 *
 * If you are not using a SPA framework but rely mostly on `XMLHttpRequests` to
 * build your site, you might be able to skip the SPA plugins and just enable
 * the {@link BOOMR.plugins.AutoXHR} plugin to measure your site.
 *
 * For information on how to include this plugin, see the {@tutorial building} tutorial.
 *
 * ## Approach
 *
 * Boomerang monitors Single Page App (SPA) navigations differently than how it
 * monitors navigations on traditional websites.
 *
 * On traditional websites, the browser completes a full navigation for every page.
 * During this navigation, the browser requests the page's HTML, JavaScript,
 * CSS, etc., from the server, and builds the page from these components. Boomerang
 * monitors this entire process.
 *
 * On SPA websites, only the first page that the visitor loads is a full
 * navigation. All subsequent navigations are handled by the SPA framework
 * itself (i.e. AngularJS), where they dynamically pull in the content they
 * need to render the new page. This is done without executing a full navigation
 * from the browser's point of view.
 *
 * Boomerang was designed for traditional websites, where a full navigation
 * occurs on each page load. During the navigation, Boomerang tracks the
 * performance characteristics of the entire page load experience. However, for
 * SPA websites, only the first page triggers a full navigation. Thus, without
 * any additional help, Boomerang will not track any subsequent interactions
 * on SPA websites.
 *
 * To give visibility into SPA website navigations, there are several Boomerang
 * plugins available for SPA frameworks, such as AngularJS, Ember.js and Backbone.js.
 * When these plugins are enabled, Boomerang is able to track all of the SPA
 * navigations beyond the first, initial navigation.
 *
 * To do so, the Boomerang SPA plugins listen for several life cycle events from
 * the framework, such as AngularJS's `$routeChangeStart`. Once it gets notified
 * of these events, the Boomerang SPA plugins start monitoring the page's markup
 * (DOM) for changes. If any of these changes trigger a download, such as a
 * XHR, image, CSS, or JavaScript, then the Boomerang SPA plugins monitor those
 * resources as well. Only once all of these new resources have been fetched do
 * the Boomerang SPA plugins consider the SPA navigation complete.
 *
 * For a further explanation of the challenges of measuring SPAs, see our
 * {@link https://www.slideshare.net/nicjansma/measuring-the-performance-of-single-page-applications|slides}
 * or our {@link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYEYtQPofhQ&t=10s|talk}.
 *
 * ## Hard and Soft Navigations
 *
 * * A **SPA Hard Navigation** is always the first navigation to the site, plus
 *   any of the work required to build the initial view.
 *    * The Hard Navigation will track at least the length of `onload`, but may also include the additional
 *      time required to load the framework (for example, Angular) and the first view.
 *    * A SPA site will only have a single SPA Hard Navigation, no "Page Load" beacons.
 *    * The `http.initiator` type is `spa_hard`
 * * A **SPA Soft Navigation** is any navigation after the Hard Navigation.
 *    * A soft navigation is an "in-page" navigation where the view changes, but
 *      the browser does not actually fully navigate.
 *    * A SPA site could have zero through many Soft Navigations
 *    * The `http.initiator` type is `spa`
 *
 * ## Navigation Timestamps
 *
 * ### Hard Navigations
 *
 * The length of a Hard Navigation is calculated from the beginning of the browser
 * navigation (e.g. `navigationStart` from NavigationTiming) through when the
 * last critical resource has been fetched for the page.
 *
 * Critical resources include Images, IFRAMEs, CSS and Scripts.
 *
 * ### Soft Navigations
 *
 * The length of a Soft Navigation is calculated from the beginning of the route
 * change event (e.g. when the user clicked somewhere to change the view) through
 * when the last critical resource has been fetched for the page.
 *
 * ## Front-End vs. Back-End Time
 *
 * For SPA navigations, the _Back End_ time (`t_resp`) is calculated as any period
 * where a XHR or Script tag was being fetched.
 *
 * The _Front End_ time (`t_page`) is calculated by taking the total SPA Page
 * Load time (`t_done`) minus _Back End_ time (`t_resp`).
 *
 * ## Beacon Parameters
 *
 * * `http.initiator`
 *     * `spa_hard` for Hard Navigations
 *     * `spa` for Soft Navigations
