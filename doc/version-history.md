# Boomerang Release Notes

## 1.737.0 (Apr 16, 2021)

### New Features

* AutoXHR: Allow SPA to start from clicks
* SPA: Option to apply Wait Filter for Hard Navs
* AutoXHR: Ignore `opacity:0`, 0px-dimension DOM elements, custom filters
* Build: Support for build flavors

### Bug Fixes

* Unblock Early beacon during missed SPA Hard Nav
* Boomerang: Always ensure Session Length is at least 1

### Documentation

* Doc: Loader Snippet Known Issues and other JSDoc changes

## 1.725.0 (November 3, 2020)
### Breaking Changes

* Boomerang will no longer send an "XHR Beacon" when an `XMLHttpRequest` **does not** result in any interesting DOM modifications (i.e. no  new images, stylesheets, IFRAMEs or other XHRs were added).  This change can be reverted to the previous behavior (of still sending an XHR Beacon) by setting the `AutoXHR.xhrRequireChanges=false` flag.

### Bug Fixes

* AutoXHR: Don't send XHR beacons if there were no DOM mutations
* AutoXHR: Don't wait on lazy-loaded images
* AutoXHR: For XHR beacons that happen before Page Load, ResourceTiming data is properly added to the XHR beacon when it is fired
* Continuity: Only add Time To Visually Ready (TTVR) to the Page Load beacon
* Errors: Avoid loop in Memory plugin for some pages
* EventTiming: Observe entries from top-level frame (e.g. for First Input Delay)
* ResourceTiming: Include the Boomerang and Config URL (for mPulse)

## 1.720.0 (July 29, 2020)
### Bug Fixes

* Boomerang: Added support for SameSite and Secure cookie attributes

## 1.715.0 (June 26, 2020)
### Bug Fixes

* History: Correctly forward arguments to `routeFilter`

### Documentation

* Docs: Release notes updated
* Docs: Continuity Cumulative Layout Shift docs
* Docs: Added additional Back-end Servers and integration guides

## 1.711.0 (June 8, 2020)
### Bug Fixes

* EventTiming: Change `firstInput` type to `first-input` per spec change

## 1.710.0 (May 6, 2020)
### Breaking Changes

* Errors: The `monitorEvents` and `monitorTimeout` options are now disabled by default.  As a result, some cross-origin JavaScript
  Errors may not report the full message (and instead will only show `Script Error.`), and the stack will not be available.
  Please see the Errors plugin documentation for details on the side-effects of re-enabling those options.
* Continuity: First Input Delay calculations have changed slightly.  The plugin will now use the Event Timing plugin
  (if available and the browser supports it) for First Input Delay calculation.  If not, `mousedown`, `touchstart` and
  `pointerdown` events are now used for First Input Delay calculations, while Scroll, Visibility and Orientation changes
  are not.  Only cancelable events are now tracked.  First Input Delay should be more accurate, though there may be less
  overall measurements (due to not tracking Scroll for First Input).

### New Features

* Event Timing plugin (enabled by default)
* ResourceTiming: Service Worker timing capture at resource level
* PaintTiming: Expose Largest Contentful Paint via `BOOMR.plugins.PaintTiming.metrics.lcp()`
