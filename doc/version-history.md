### Documentation

* Issue 1090: Doc: Loader Snippet Known Issues and other JSDoc changes

## 1.725.0 (November 3, 2020)

### Breaking Changes

* Boomerang will no longer send an "XHR Beacon" when an `XMLHttpRequest` **does not** result in any interesting DOM modifications (i.e. no  new images, stylesheets, IFRAMEs or other XHRs were added).  This change can be reverted to the previous behavior (of still sending an XHR Beacon) by setting the `AutoXHR.xhrRequireChanges=false` flag.

### Bug Fixes

* Issue 868: AutoXHR: Don't send XHR beacons if there were no DOM mutations
* Issue 1081: AutoXHR: Don't wait on lazy-loaded images
* Issue 1079: AutoXHR: For XHR beacons that happen before Page Load, ResourceTiming data is properly added to the XHR beacon when it is fired
* Issue 1077: Continuity: Only add Time To Visually Ready (TTVR) to the Page Load beacon
* Issue 1082: Memory: Avoid loop in Memory plugin for some pages
* Issue 1087: EventTiming: Observe entries from top-level frame (e.g. for First Input Delay)
* Issue 1073: ResourceTiming: Include the Boomerang and Config URL (for mPulse)

## 1.720.0 (July 29, 2020)

### Bug Fixes

* Issue 1075: Boomerang: Added support for SameSite and Secure cookie attributes

## 1.715.0 (June 26, 2020)

### Bug Fixes

* Issue 1069: History: Correctly forward arguments to `routeFilter`

### Documentation

* Issue 1069: Docs: Release notes updated
* Issue 1069: Docs: Continuity Cumulative Layout Shift docs
* Issue 1069: Docs: Added additional Back-end Servers and integration guides

## 1.711.0 (June 8, 2020)

### Bug Fixes

* Issue 1062: EventTiming: Change `firstInput` type to `first-input` per spec change

## 1.710.0 (May 6, 2020)

### Breaking Changes

* Issue 1057: Errors: The `monitorEvents` and `monitorTimeout` options are now disabled by default.  As a result, some cross-origin JavaScript
  Errors may not report the full message (and instead will only show `Script Error.`), and the stack will not be available.
  Please see the Errors plugin documentation for details on the side-effects of re-enabling those options.
* Issue 1051: Continuity: First Input Delay calculations have changed slightly.  The plugin will now use the Event Timing plugin
  (if available and the browser supports it) for First Input Delay calculation.  If not, `mousedown`, `touchstart` and
  `pointerdown` events are now used for First Input Delay calculations, while Scroll, Visibility and Orientation changes
  are not.  Only cancelable events are now tracked.  First Input Delay should be more accurate, though there may be less
  overall measurements (due to not tracking Scroll for First Input).

### New Features

* Issue 1000: Event Timing plugin (enabled by default)
* Issue 1044: ResourceTiming: Service Worker timing capture at resource level
* Issue 1049: PaintTiming: Expose Largest Contentful Paint via `BOOMR.plugins.PaintTiming.metrics.lcp()`
