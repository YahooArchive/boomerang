## What?

boomerang is a piece of javascript that you add to your web pages, where it measures
the performance of your website from your end user's point of view.  It has the ability
to send this data back to your server for further analysis.  With boomerang, you find
out exactly how fast your users think your site is.

boomerang is opensource and released under the BSD license,
and we have a whole bunch of documentation about it.
