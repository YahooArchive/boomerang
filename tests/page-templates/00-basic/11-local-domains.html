<pre>  Why is this test here?
  ======================
  
  Some tests require us to have a proper domain and port assigned and requesting resources from those domains+ports 
  as this is the only way we can ensure a cookie is created and session details can be validated. 

  In this set of tests we ensure that both the port and domain are setup as expected in our environment.
