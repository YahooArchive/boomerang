  Why is this test here?
  ======================

  Some tests require us to have a proper domain and port assigned and requesting resources from those domains+ports
  as this is the only way we can ensure a cookie is created and session details can be validated.

  In this set of tests we ensure that both the port and domain are setup as expected in our environment.
